# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. Personally coming from me, it's a great website to practice your skills in.

## Overview

### Screenshot

This is the website that I made. It is made in 1 hour. This doesn't have any special javascript or frameworks, just plain HTML and CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- DRY flow



### What I learned

I never heard of google fonts before. If I needed custom fonts, I would just download the font file. With Google Fonts, I don't need to download multiple files. I used to learn in a bootcamp that told me a font file was the only way to integrate custom fonts. Therefore, I never saw its so easy to integrate like this: 

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```


### Continued development

Colors are a major issue for me. I can't seem to check color contrast on some colors. This is a big issue in my portfolio where I adapted the colors in dark mode. I am looking to make this ðŸª³ of mine to disappear. (sorry for the cheesy joke) Just addressing the elephant in the room, I am also looking to make a website a walk in the park for anyone who is differently abled.
